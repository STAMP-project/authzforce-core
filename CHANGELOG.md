# Change log
All notable changes to this project are documented in this file following the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com) conventions. 


## 3.9.0 
### Added
- New PdpExtensionLoader method providing the list of available extensions of a given type: datatype, function, combining algorithm, etc.

### Removed
- dnsName-equal and ipAddress-equal functions, which are not to be used because they are not in XACML spec (regexp-match equivalent must be used instead)

### Fixed
- NullPointerException when defining unknown combining algorithm ID in PDP configuration
- PdpExtensionLoader throwing IllegalArgumentException if no extension found of this type, instead of returning an empty list when the extension type is actually valid but no extension found

### Tests
- New tests for custom extensions: result filter (implements CombinedDecision from XACML Multiple Decision Profile), simple datatype (dnsname-value from XACML DLP/NAC Profile), complex datatype (XACML Policy), function (dnsname-value-equal from XACML DLP/NAC Profile), combining algorithm (on-permit-apply-second from XACML Additional Combining Algorithms Profile)


## 3.8.3
### Fixed 
- Removing Javadoc @author tag added automatically by maven Javadoc plugin without us knowing
- PDP schema: removed limits (100) for maxVarRefDepth and maxPolicyRefDepth attributes. Hard arbitrary limits should not be in the XML schema.


## 3.8.2
### Fixed
- Javadoc comments


## 3.8.1
### Fixed
- Removed use of SAXON StandardURIChecker for validating anyURI XACML AttributeValues causing "possible memory leak" errors in Tomcat, as confirmed by: https://sourceforge.net/p/saxon/mailman/message/27043134 and https://sourceforge.net/p/saxon/mailman/saxon-help/thread/4F9E683E.8060001@saxonica.com/. Although XACML 3.0 still refers to XSD 1.0 which has a stricter definition of anyURI than XSD 1.1, the fix consisted to use XSD 1.1 anyURI definition for XACML anyURI AttributeValues. In this definition, anyURI and string datatypes have same value space (refer to XSD 1.1 Datatypes document or SAXON note http://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation9.4/changes/intro93/xsd11-93.html or mailing list: https://sourceforge.net/p/saxon/mailman/saxon-help/thread/4F9E683E.8060001@saxonica.com/) , therefore anyURI-specific validation is removed and anyURI values are accepted like string values by the program. However, this does not affect XML schema validation of Policy/PolicySet/Request documents against OASIS XACML 3.0 schema, where the XSD 1.0 definition of anyURI still applies.


## 3.8.0
### Changed
- PDP XML schema: maxVariableRefDepth and maxPolicyRefDepth attributes made optional (instead of required)

### Added
- PDP XML schema: 'requestFilter' attribute (RequestFilter extension): 
	- Added documentation about natively supported values, with '-lax' suffix meaning that duplicate <Attribute> with same meta-data in the same <Attributes> element of a Request is allowed (in compliance with XACML 3.0 core spec, ยง7.3.3), and '-strict' suffix meaning that it is not allowed (not strictly compliant with XACML 3.0 Core, section 7.3.3):
		- 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:default-lax' and 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:default-strict': default requestFilter limited to what is specified in XACML 3.0 Core specification
		- 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:multiple:repeated-attribute-categories-lax' and 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:multiple:repeated-attribute-categories-strict': implement Multiple Decision Profile, section 2.3 (repeated attribute categories)
	- Added XSD-defined default value for this 'requestFilter' attribute: 'urn:ow2:authzforce:xacml:request-filter:default-lax'
- Support for Extended Indeterminate values (XACML 3.0 Core specification, section 7.10-7.14, appendix C: combining algorithms)
- PdpImpl#getStaticApplicablePolicies() method that provides all the PDP's applicable policies (root and referenced - directly or indirectly - from the root policy) if all are statically resolved. This allows PDP clients to know all the policies (if statically resolved) possibly used by the PDP during the evaluation.


## 3.7.0
### Added
- Root policy provider module based on any policy-by-reference provider (parameter is the root policy reference to be resolved by the policy-by-reference provider)

### Changed
- PDP configuration XSD version -> 3.6.1 (supporting new configuration type for the new ref-based Root policy provider module mentioned in previous section)

### Removed
- Moved/Refactored API classes sufficient for implementing PDP extensions (Datatypes, Functions, Policy/Attribute providers, etc.) to a separate project: authzforce-ce-core-pdp-api

### Fixed
- Broken validation of max policy reference depth


## 3.6.0
### Added
- Support all [XACML 3.0 conformance tests](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xacml-comment/201404/msg00001.html) published by AT&T on XACML mailing list in March 2014, except IIA010, IIA012, IIA024, IID029, IID030, III.C.2, III.C.3, IIIE301, IIIE303, II.G.2-6 (see also [README](src\test\resources\conformance\xacml-3.0-from-2.0-ct\README.md) ); with specific adaptations and enhancements:
  1. XACML 3.0 Schema validation in all conformance tests (original files are not all compliant with XACML 3.0). 
  1. The original conformance test folder contains hundreds of files; for better readability and management, the folder is split in *mandatory* folder for tests on supported mandatory features (XACMl 3.0 core), *optional* folder for supported optional features (XACML 3.0 core and profiles), and *unsupported* for unsupported features.
  1. For tests requiring a custom attribute finder, added a file with suffix `AttributeProvider.xml` that configures the `TestAttributeProviderModule`. This configuration file must contain a list of `Attributes` elements defining the attributes that this attribute provider is able to provide, with their constant values.
  1. For tests requiring policies to be referenced via Policy(Set)IdReferences, added a directory named `refPolicies` containing a XACML Policy(Set) file per referenced Policy(Set).
  1. For tests of Request syntax validation (syntax error expected to be detected by Authzforce PDP at initialization-time, i.e. before any Request evaluation), added suffix `.ignore` to the original test Policy(Set) and Response files.
  1. For tests of Policy(Set) syntax validation (syntax error expected to be detected by Authzforce PDP at initialization-time, i.e. before any Request evaluation), added suffix `.ignore` to the original test Request and Response files.
- [HTML description](\src\test\resources\conformance\xacml-3.0-from-2.0-ct\ConformanceTests.html) of XACML 3.0 conformance tests
- Support of Policy(Set)Version in Policy(Set)IdReference handled by the native policy finder
- Support for Variable evaluation in Policy with scope management (variable is local to Policy where defined and inherited by Rules)
- Added support of xpathExpressions (optional XACML feature) in Request with support of namespace-prefix mappings extracted from XML document (XACML Request/Policy(Set)/Rule) (typically via `xmlns` declarations) where the xpathExpression is defined, e.g. XACML Request or Policy(Set).
- PDP configuration option to enable/disable XPath support (evaluation of xpathExpression datatype in Request/Policy(Set)/Rule, AttributeSelector and xpath functions)
- Added support of RequestDefaults/XPathVersion (optional XACML features) for evaluation of xpathExpressions in Request, and PolicyDefaults/XPathVersion (optional XACML feature) for evaluation of xpathExpressions and AttributeSelectors in Policy(Set) documents.
- Added support of ReturnPolicyIdList (optional XACML feature) to return identifiers of policies found applicable for the Request
- Added support of xpath-node-count function (optional XACML feature)
- New modes of request parsing/filtering and attribute matching to enforce best practices and optimize Request processing:
  1. *Strict Attribute Issuer match*: in this mode, an AttributeDesignator without Issuer only matches XACML Request Attributes without Issuer (faster if all Attributes have an Issuer which is recommended, but not fully XACML (ยง5.29) compliant)
  2. *Allow Attribute duplicates*: allows defining multi-valued attributes by repeating the same XACML Attribute (same AttributeId) within a XACML Attributes element (same Category). Indeed, not allowing this enables the PDP to parse and evaluate Requests more efficiently, especially if you know the Requests to be well-formed, i.e. all AttributeValues of a given Attribute are grouped together in the same `<Attribute>` element. However, it may not be fully compliant with the XACML spec according to a [discussion](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xacml-dev/201507/msg00001.html) on the xacml-dev mailing list, referring to the XACML 3.0 core spec, ยง7.3.3, that indicates that multiple occurrences of the same `<Attribute>` with same meta-data but different values should be considered equivalent to a single `<Attribute>` element with same meta-data and merged values (multi-valued Attribute). Moreover, the XACML 3.0 conformance test 'IIIA024' expects this behavior: the multiple subject-id Attributes are expected to result in a multi-value bag during evaluation of the `<AttributeDesignator>`.
- Features to prevent circular references in Policy(Set)IdReferences or VariableReference
- Features to limit depth of PolicySetIdReference or VariableReference chain (otherwise no theoretical limit)

### Changed
- TestMatchAlg class replaced with official conformance test on Target matching: group II.B.
- Improved `TestUtils` class to allow configuring a directory of referenced policies for Policy(Set)IdReferences, to enable/disable XPath support, and to configure a specific RequestFilter ID, e.g. to use the MultipleDecisionProfile for conformance tests of 'optional' features.
- Renamed RELEASE-NOTES.md to CHANGELOG.md to adopt conventions from [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com).
- Logback dependency scope (maven) from `compile` to `test` (not required for compiling, only for tests, any SLF4J-compatible library may be used at runtime).
- Moved old README.md content to the server project since it does not apply anymore to this project but to the AuthzForce server project.

### Fixed 
- Issues reported by PMD and findbugs
- Fixed issues in [XACML 3.0 conformance tests](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xacml-comment/201404/msg00001.html) published by AT&T on XACML mailing list in March 2014, see [README](src\test\resources\conformance\xacml-3.0-from-2.0-ct\README.md).
- In logical OR, AND and N-OF functions, an Indeterminate argument results in Indeterminate result. 
  1. FIX for OR function: If at least one True argument, return True regardless of Indeterminate arguments; else (no True) if there is at least one Indeterminate, return Indeterminate, return Indeterminate; else (no True/Indeterminate -> all false) return false
  1. FIX for AND function: If at least one False argument, return False regardless of Indeterminate arguments; else (no False) if there is at least one Indeterminate, return Indeterminate, return Indeterminate; else (no False/Indeterminate -> all true) return true
  1. FIX for N-OF function: similar to OR but checking if there are at least N Trues instead of 1, in the remaining arguments; else there is/are n True(s) with `n < N`; if there are at least `(N-n)` Indeterminate, return Indeterminate; else return false.
- Misleading IllegalArgumentException error for XML-schema-valid anyURI but not valid for `java.net.URI` class. Fixed by using `java.lang.String` instead and validating strings according to anyURI definition with Saxon library
- RuntimeException when no subject and no resource and no action attributes in the XACML request
